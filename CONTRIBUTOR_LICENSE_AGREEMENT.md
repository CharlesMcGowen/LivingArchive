# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EgoLlama Gateway ("the Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Project maintainers.

By submitting a Contribution (as defined below), you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to EgoLlama Contributors ("Licensor").

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Licensor.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Licensor for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Licensor (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"Project"** means EgoLlama Gateway and any related software, documentation, or other materials owned or managed by the Licensor.

**"Work"** means the work of authorship which is made available by the Licensor to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Dual Licensing Rights

You understand and agree that the Project uses a **dual-licensing model**:
- **Community Edition**: Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
- **Commercial Edition**: Licensed under the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)

By signing this Agreement, You grant the Licensor the right to distribute Your Contributions under **both** licensing terms (Apache 2.0 and BSL 1.1), including the right to:
- Offer Your Contributions under BSL 1.1 for commercial use
- Transition Your Contributions to Apache 2.0 after the Change Date specified in the BSL
- Re-license Your Contributions as needed to maintain the dual-licensing business model

This grant is necessary to ensure that the Project can maintain its dual-licensing strategy while accepting community contributions.

## 5. You Own Your Contributions

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Licensor, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA with the Licensor.

## 6. Original Work

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 7. Third-Party Content

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Licensor separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## 8. No Implied Warranties

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 9. No Obligation to Use

Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to prevent the Licensor from licensing or distributing the Project under different licensing terms or from making use of Contributions under those terms, provided the Licensor has the legal right to do so.
